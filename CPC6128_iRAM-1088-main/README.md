# iRAM/1088 - and internal RAM expansion for Amstrad CPC 6128 (upgrade to 1088K)

## License

The expansion and all resources are free to use for personal use.

It is released under the same license as the [iRAM/640 project](https://github.com/etomuc/CPC6128_iRAM-640). The price for commercial offers may be adjusted to accomodate for the two SRAMs but must not exceed a 20% uplift compared to the permitted iRAM/640 prices. 

## Differences to iRAM/640

- provides 1088K of total RAM (64K base RAM + 1024 SRAM)
- the second 64K RAM bank of the 6128 is not used

The hardware differences are minimal:

* Use 2 SMD SRAMs AS6C4008 SOP32 (instead of 1 DIP SRAM)
* One more capacitor 100nF

## Building the iRAM/1088

- Get PCB from PCBWay here: https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/CPC_iRAM_1088_1MB_internal_RAM_expansion_for_the_Amstrad_CPC_6128_ce7298f2.html
- or use the PCB gerber files that can be found in the files folder on this project. 
- CPLD programming files: please download the JED files from the files folder on the [iRAM/640 project](https://github.com/etomuc/CPC6128_iRAM-640). Those JED files already contain the required logic to address 1088MB. 

Otherwise please refer to the building instructions of the iRAM/640. The process is mostly identical except for two steps:

- the second SRAM needs to be soldered on the bottom side of the PCB
- make sure to close the 1MB bridge on the bottom side of the PCB

### 576K option

It's possible to only use a single SRAM which will give you a total of 576K RAM. 

- solder one SRAM on top of the PCB and leave the spot on thebottom side empty
- don't close the 1MB bridge on the bottom
- instead add the 10K (4.7K is also fine) resistor next to it
